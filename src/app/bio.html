    <h2 class="title">My journey in Technology</h2>
    <p class="text">
      Graduated in Computer Science at UFBA, I work as a Senior Software Development Consultant at ThoughtWorks.
      I am a Google Developer Expert in Web and Angular Technologies.
      I have more than 12 years of experience in software development, mostly as a full stack developer.
      Since 2017, I started to work specifically with front-end development and became specialized in this area.
      I am a speaker and believe that sharing knowledge is a way to democratize technology for everyone.
